    Commission:  I will like to apologize because of being a day late with my reports.
    \ The reason is I have not been feeling physically healthy!  And, I thought because
    February 15, 2009 was on a Sunday, I could wait until the next business day.  I
    also will like to say my committee's bank must had started to distrust me over
    gossip or something.  Or, they prefered to support Mr. Obama, McCain, or somebody
    else.  They got where they would not trust cashing any of the money orders or
    moneygrams I try to deposit.  And, I am not sure what has been going on because
    of the criminal threats imposed on a contributor or against any of my own relatives
    and ownself. And, the multiple reasons seem to be to complexed to be sure the
    potential victims will survive.  Anyway! Since my bank has closed my account.
    \  I will need to make an amendment after I am sure about what has happened to
    my bank account.  Note:  My committee and help sure need to have a better income.
