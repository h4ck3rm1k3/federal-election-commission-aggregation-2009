    Detailed Summary have been corrected. The refunds from Verizon Online on Schedule
    A for Line 15 were originally reported on Schedule H4, but the Non-Federal portion
    was never moved as part of an allocation transfer.  Therefore, there are no subsequent
    transfers back to the Non-Federal account required. The payment for 'Entertainment'
    on Schedule B was for a fundraising event and was not for the benefit of any candidate
    for federal office. There were no payments made for 'Posting' on the Committee's
    September Monthly report. The payments for 'Printing' were related to general
    fundraising letters and expenses related to the Committee's State Convention.
    \ They were not for the benefit of any candidate for federal office. The payment
    for 'Telemarketing fees'  was for ongoing fundraising efforts of the Committee.
    \ No portion of this expenditure involved public communication, voter drive activity,
    or express advocacy of a federal candidate. The payment for 'Event Equipment'
    was for staging fees for the Committee's State Convention. Payments classified
    as 'Exempt' on Schedule B for Line 30b do meet teh definition of excempt activity
    as detailed in the Campaign Guide.  No transfers-in from National Party Commitees,
    including the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign
    Committee were used in paying for these exempt activities. The debt to the Non-Federal
    Account was transferred in September and appears on the Committee's amended October
    Monthly report. The payment for 'Salary' on Schedule H4 has been moved to Schedule
    B for Line 30(b). The payment for 'Communications Equipment' was for generic equipment
    for the press department and was not for the benefit of a federal candidate. The
    in-kind from Persuad Companies appears on a Schedule H3 and as a 100% Non-Federal
    disbursement on Schedule H4. The final H4 that shows the transfer of the federal
    portion appears on the Committee's October Monthly. Payments for 'Catering,' 'Lighting/staging/sound,'
    and 'Site Rental' have been moved to Schedule B for Line 30(b). "
