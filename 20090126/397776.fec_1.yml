      for Federal office and that promoted, supported, attacked or opposed any such
      candidate for Federal office. All disbursements for salaries and benefits disclosed
      on Schedule H4 are for employees who did not spend more than 25% of their compensated

      in connection with a Federal election. The Committee uses the Escrow option
