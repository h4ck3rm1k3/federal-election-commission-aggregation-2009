      more than it should have been.  All transfers for allocated activity were made

      communication that referred to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office
      and that promoted, supported, attacked or opposed any such candidate for Federal
      office. All disbursements for salaries and benefits disclosed on Schedule H4
      are for employees who did not spend more than 25% of their compensated time
      during the reporting period on Federal election activities or activities in
      connection with a Federal election. The Committee uses the Escrow option for
      receipt of corporate in-kind donations as provided for by the Commission in
      Advisory Opinion 1992-33. The method ensures that prohibited sources are not
      used to fund the federal share of allocable activity expenses. There were no
      corporate in-kinds during this reporting period and the balances in the escrow
      accounts are summarized as follows:   Administrative Escrow account:  2/29/08
