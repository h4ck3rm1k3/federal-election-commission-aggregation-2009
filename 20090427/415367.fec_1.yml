    is filing this amended report to re-categorize expenditures for T-shirts, buttons
    and bumper stickers distributed to APWU members as member communications, on line
    21(b) of the amended report.   The T-shirts and buttons were distributed to members
    attending the APWU Biennial National Convention.  Members were encouraged to wear
    their buttons to the convention, and one day of the Convention was designated
    as T-shirt day.  These efforts were directed to APWU members to encourage them
    to support a particular candidate.  The bumper stickers were distributed to APWU
    members to be displayed on cars in employee parking lots used by APWU members.
    \    We are re-categorizing expenditures for yard signs as independent expenditures,
    and we are filing the required notices of these expenditures.  The 48-hour report
    of these expenditures was inadvertently not made in a timely manner.  The APWU
    was unaware of the 48-hour reporting requirement.  We respectfully request that
    the penalty for failing to file the 48 hour report in a timely manner be waived
