    Analyst  999 E Street, NW  Washington, DC   20463    In RE:\t\tScott Murphy for
    Congress (C00458893)  \t\tJuly Quarterly Report (4/21/09 - 6/30/09)      Dear
    Ms. Iovino:    This amendment is in response to your Request for Additional Information
    dated August 18, 2009.    The contribution in question from Samuel Cole was an
    excessive contribution, and the excessive portion has been refunded.  However,
    please note that the contributions listed in your letter from Ameripac and the
    Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  were earmarked contributions for
    which those committees acted as a conduit, and were reported as such.  They are
    therefore not excessive contributions.  The coverage dates for the 2010 election
    cycle have been udpated to reflect the 4/1/09 through 11/2/10 dates.  The column
    B figures and the aggregate cycle to date figures for donors now reflect the correct
    figures.  The Other election designations on lines 11(c) and 12 have been updated
    to reflect the 2009 special election cycle.  In addition to your questions, this
    amendment adds debt which was not previously reported due to late information.
    \ Finally, an in-kind contribution from the DCCC has been added to this report,
    and an expenditure to Jeremy Hoffman which was a replacement for a 4/9/09 check
    has been removed.  It is hoped that the above is responsive to your concerns.
    \ Please be in touch with the Committee should you have additional question concerning
    this matter.      Thank you.    Sincerely,  John Paul Franck  Treasurer  \n"

    value: "Ms. Amanda J. Iovino\t  Campaign Finance Analyst  999 E Street, NW  Washington,
      DC   20463    In RE:\t\tScott Murphy for Congress (C00458893)  \t\tJuly Quarterly
      Report (4/21/09 - 6/30/09)      Dear Ms. Iovino:    This amendment is in response
      to your Request for Additional Information dated August 18, 2009.    The contribution
      in question from Samuel Cole was an excessive contribution, and the excessive
      portion has been refunded.  However, please note that the contributions listed
      in your letter from Ameripac and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
      \ were earmarked contributions for which those committees acted as a conduit,
      and were reported as such.  They are therefore not excessive contributions.
      \ The coverage dates for the 2010 election cycle have been udpated to reflect
      the 4/1/09 through 11/2/10 dates.  The column B figures and the aggregate cycle
      to date figures for donors now reflect the correct figures.  The Other election
      designations on lines 11(c) and 12 have been updated to reflect the 2009 special
      election cycle.  In addition to your questions, this amendment adds debt which
      was not previously reported due to late information.  Finally, an in-kind contribution
      from the DCCC has been added to this report, and an expenditure to Jeremy Hoffman
      which was a replacement for a 4/9/09 check has been removed.  It is hoped that
      the above is responsive to your concerns.  Please be in touch with the Committee
      should you have additional question concerning this matter.      Thank you.
      \   Sincerely,  John Paul Franck  Treasurer  \n"
