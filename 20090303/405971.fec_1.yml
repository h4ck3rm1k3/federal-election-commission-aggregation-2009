    to your correspondence of January 29, 2009.   As you know, our Committee had a
    great deal of difficulty reporting a true Cash-on-Hand since our origional Aprl
    15th Quarterly.  The confusion came from a staff member accidently creating a
    new and separate April Quarterly Report that did not mesh with with the Masterfile
    that was initiated in the campaigns 12-day Pre-Special Report.  To add to the
    confusion, all of the Sawyer for Congress 48-hour notices were identified as 'MEMOs,
    and therefore did not add into the April Reports either.  We realized that there
    was a problem when we could not get the Cash on Hand line to jive with our internal
    records. We knew the info was entered, but it wouldn't total on the Summary Sheets.
    \ We worked with Ms. Sally Bacon at that time, and when she saw that we could
    not work out the problem, she advised us to file the report As-Is , and to wait
    until the Commission contacted us to clarify any problems.  The Campaign was next
    notified on August 26, 2008 by yourself, and we have worked consistantly with
    you and the Technical Staff to realize and resolve these problems.  We found that
    the ending balance of the July Report was inflated due to Duplicate Entries that
    came from the Technical Staff's attempts to help us properly re-configure our
    report.  The proper balances are reflected in the A2: Oct. Report.  Thank you
