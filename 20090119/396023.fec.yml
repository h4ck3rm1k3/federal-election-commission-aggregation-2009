      employees who did not spend more than 25% of their compensated time during the

      with a Federal election. The Committee uses the Escrow option for receipt of
      corporate in-kind donations as provided for by the Commission in Advisory Opinion
      1992-33. The method ensures that prohibited sources are not used to fund the
      federal share of allocable activity expenses. In-kind details and the escrow

      covering 1/1/08 - 1/31/08, Schedule D reflected an outstanding balance of $3,670
      for Strategic Direction.com. When this bill was subsequently paid in February,
      it was determined that the correct vendor for this debt was Strategic Fundraising
      instead. This balance was added to the Outstanding Balance at beginning of period
      for Strategic Fundraising of $4,351.50 for a new beginning balance of $8,021.50
      on this report and there is no Outstanding Balance at beginning of period for

      disbursement to Heidi Watzak (reported on line 30b of the report) for $50. The
      itemization does not show up on the report because the total expenditure is
      under the itemization threshold of $200.  '

    \ 2/22/08 Sembler Company in-kind of $2,862.93 as reflected on Sch H4 and transfer
    on Sch H3 using $229.03 of escrow balance.  2/25/08 Leon Advertising in-kind of
    $12,500 as reflected on Sch H4 and transfer on Sch H3 using $1,000 of escrow balance.
    \ 2/29/08 balance in MD-08 escrow account of $11,786.73.  On the report covering
    1/1/08 - 1/31/08, Schedule D reflected an outstanding balance of $3,670 for Strategic
    Direction.com. When this bill was subsequently paid in February, it was determined
    that the correct vendor for this debt was Strategic Fundraising instead. This
    balance was added to the Outstanding Balance at beginning of period for Strategic
    Fundraising of $4,351.50 for a new beginning balance of $8,021.50 on this report
    and there is no Outstanding Balance at beginning of period for Strategic Direction.com.
    \  On page 113 of this months report, there is an itemized disbursement to Heidi
    Watzak (reported on line 30b of the report) for $50. The itemization does not
    show up on the report because the total expenditure is under the itemization threshold
    of $200.  \x1C"
